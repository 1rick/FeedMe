*RSS Feed Generator*

**Purpose**
This is my first experiment with programming, so I'm bound to be doing a ton of stuff wrong here. Mostly a personal project driven by the need to search out news feeds in one place, rather than having to go to each site one by one to collect them. 

**Tools used**
* [Simple Pie version 1.1.3](https://github.com/rmccue/SimplePie/zipball/1.1.3) Note that version 1.2 gave me errors.

**Shout out to...**
CSS Tricks for a great [Simple Pie screencast](http://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/55-adding-rss-content-with-simplepie/)

**Possible improvements on the horizon**
Add checkboxes to select which feeds to display. It would be nice to add some ajaxy goodness. If I knew enough about ajax of course… Might be nice to combine all selected feeds into a super-feed.
